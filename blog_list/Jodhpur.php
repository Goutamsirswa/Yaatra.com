<p>While everyone knows Jodhpur is nicknamed the Blue City, there is no definitive explanation for how or why the sobriquet came to be. However, here are some of the theories as to why Indiaâ€™s Jodhpur is known as the Blue City.
First things first, of course, not all Jodhpur is painted blue, only the old town area near the Mehrangarh Fort has buildings mainly painted in blue hues. Standing atop the Mehrangarh Fort and gazing at the blue-patterned houses is a delight for the eyes and a great photo opportunity.</p>  
<h2 class="img_sub_head">Blue defines the Social Status </h2>
            <p>
                Yet another belief is that the blue colour is determinant of social status. This story goes back centuries when the Hindu caste system was considered to be the basis for determining the social status. According to the local lore, the Brahmin community (the priestly caste of India) painted their houses blue in order to differentiate themselves from the lower-caste communities, and since that time, blue is linked with the Brahmins. You might well hear these buildings referred to as Brahmin houses.

         <p>There are those who believe that the blue colour help deter termites. According to this idea, termites damaged many historic structures and buildings in the city. So, in order to keep their property safe from these unwelcoming pests, the residents painted their houses with blue paint. This paint is a mixture of copper sulphate and limestone that not only wards off bugs, but also imparts a soothing and calming effect. The residents who advocate this theory strictly oppose the belief that blue is associated with the Brahmins. In their favour, they state that there are just as many families from other castes living in the blue-painted houses.</p>
         <h2 class="img_sub_head">To keep the houses cool</h2>
         <p>Some locals believe that the colour blue is a good reflector of sun rays, so painting the house like this will keep their house cool in warmer months.

            Speaking to locals will get you a host of new theories and reasons. Regardless of the truth, the blue landscape is aesthetically pleasing nonetheless.</p>
